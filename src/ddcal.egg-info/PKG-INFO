# Overview

A heuristic one dimensional clustering algorithm called DDCAL (Density Distribution Cluster Algorithm) that is based on iterative feature scaling.
The algorithm aims as first order to even distribute data into clusters by considering as well as second order to minimize the variance inside each cluster and maximizing the distances between clusters.

The algorithm is designed to be used for visualization, e.g., on choropleth maps.


# Basic Usage
```
pip install -i https://pypi.org/simple/ ddcal
```

```
from clustering.ddcal import DDCAL

# load data
frequencies = [0, 1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 5, 30, 88]

# initialize parameters
ddcal = DDCAL(n_clusters=3, feature_boundary_min=0.1, feature_boundary_max=0.49,
                  num_simulations=20, q_tolerance=0.45, q_tolerance_increase_step=0.5)

# execute DDCAL algorithm
ddcal.fit(frequencies)

# print/use results
print(ddcal.sorted_data)
print(ddcal.labels_sorted_data)
```
